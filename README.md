# Retro Racer

So, I made this game a while ago and wanted to share it. To anyone reading the code, beware, a lot of the names and documentation is written in French.
It requires `pyxel` and `pygame` to run.

## Some game controls

`Enter` to start.
Avoid the white cars using the `arrow keys`.
When the meter on the right side of the screen is full, use `Space` to activate slow-motion.

Power-ups:
The `hearts` give you extra health.
The `square thingy` temporarily turns your car into a bulldozer, allowing you to destroy the other cars and rendering you invincible.


Merci!
